# just-another-sound-pack-generator

Jasper is a python script to generate sound packs for opentx flair radios (OpenTX/EdgeTX, Ethos)

It can read csv files in the following format: `path;filename;spoken-text`
The script processes the csv line by line and will request the synthesized audio from the tts service and use ffmpeg to normalize, convert and save to a `.wav` file.
Files will be saved as 16bit mono 32khz wave.

The Script currently supports: Google Cloud Text-to-Speech AI, Microsoft Azure Text-to-Speech, Amazon Polly, IBM Watson Text to Speech nad ElevenLabs.

## Disclaimer

**The voices generated by this software are ai-generated.**

## Requirements

- python >= 3.10
- ffmpeg >= 4.0 (needs to be on PATH)

Clone repository and make a python virtual environment, afterwards:

```
pip install azure-cognitiveservices-speech boto3 elevenlabs google-cloud-texttospeech ibm-watson numpy pydub PyYAML sounddevice soundfile customtkinter
```

or just use the requiremnts.txt `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

To use this script you need at least one account with one of the supported TTS providers (all of the them currently offer free personal plans).
Make a copy of config_example.yaml and rename it to config.yaml. Edit the access tokens for the service you're going to use (Google Cloud TTS needs a json credentials file, the file must be located in the root directory and named googletts_cred.json)

```
python jasper.py -s microsoft -f "soundlists\ethos\audio_en.csv" -n "ethos-system-sounds-en-male-ryan-1.4.15"
```

Optional parameter: -o
Overwrites values set in the config (should be used in batch processing)

```
python jasper.py -s microsoft -f "soundlists\de-DE-custom.csv" -n "custom-sounds-de-male-conrad-1.0" -o language=de-DE,voice_id=de-DE-ConradNeural,speaking_rate=0.83
```

## GUI for voice testing

the gui-tts-tester.py uses a customtkinter interface to quickly test different voices and locales.
Just run:

```
python gui-tts-tester.py
```

## TODO List

- [ ] batch processing
- [ ] automatic releases/workflow
- [ ] ethos 1.5 support
- [ ] support translate single word/phrase with parameter
