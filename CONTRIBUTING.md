You can help us in the following ways:

Getting feedback on translations, pronunciation or the quality of a voice helps us the most. You can also suggest new languages to translate or new phrases for the custom sound files.

Please open a [new issue](https://github.com/Raxol/just-another-sound-pack-generator/issues/new) for any of these reasons.

The generated files may not always sound as if they were spoken by a native speaker. For this reason, it is sometimes necessary to adapt the translations or rephrase sentences. To check the quality of the output we need your feedback, mainly from native speakers, as we only speak a few languages ourselves.
